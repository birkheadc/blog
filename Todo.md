# Docker
- Create a `.dockerignore` and start building it.
- There is not a lot of useful information for creating a general Rails container online, so I'm pretty much on my own.
- Figure out the docker volume setup to save articles.

# Database
- Move away from sqlite probably?

# Production
- Is just running `rails s` with environment set to `production` all you have to do? Or am I missing something huge here...
